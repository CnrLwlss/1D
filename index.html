          <p>The idea behind this code is to convert the two-dimensional pattern of colours in photographs into one-dimensional strips.  Concentrating on a strip of pixels, essentially one pixel wide but stretched out to make the image easier to see, emphasises the discreteness and tininess of pixels.  Scanning through, say the height of a photo, and patching the resulting stretched, one-dimensional images together in a video, creates an odd kind of movement from a still image, and highlights different aspects of the structure of the image and its colour palette, compared to looking at the original, still version.</p>

		  <p>The central oneDHoriz function is very simple.  Essentially the user specifies a row in an image and the function goes through each pixel in that row, copying that pixel's colour to a new image, but also copying that colour up and down the column of the new image to fill it completely.  The script uses two excellent Python packages. <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a> to convert input images into an array of numbers and to operate on those arrays and the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library</a> (PIL) to open, resize and save images to hard-drive.  NumPy allows fast, vectorised sampling from the array version of the image and fast, vectorised copying to a target array.  PIL is fast, easy to use and handles a wide range of file-types and common image operations (such as resizing, rotation etc.).

		  <p>The resulting strips of colour are surprising and chaotic, however they are much more satisfying to look at than random colours.  Although when taking a one-dimensional view of a two-dimensional object we throw away a lot of information about the source image, the patterns in the one-dimensional output are strongly influenced by the order (composition, focus, dynamic range and structure) of the source two-dimensional photograph.  Several videos demonstrating sequential slicing of photographs to generate movement can be found <a href="https://vimeo.com/album/1598339">here</a> or viewed below.  The separators above are generated using the same tools.
